abstract = {We present a framework to build a multiobjective algorithm from single-objective ones. This framework addresses the p \texttimes{} n-dimensional problem of finding p solutions in an n-dimensional search space, maximizing an indicator by dynamic subspace optimization. Each single-objective algorithm optimizes the indicator function given p - 1 fixed solutions. Crucially, dominated solutions minimize their distance to the empirical Pareto front defined by these p - 1 solutions. We instantiate the framework with CMA-ES as single-objective optimizer. The new algorithm, COMO-CMA-ES, is empirically shown to converge linearly on bi-objective convex-quadratic problems and is compared to MO-CMA-ES, NSGA-II and SMS-EMOA.},

In this paper an extensive, quantitative comparison is presented, applying four multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to an extended 0/1 knapsack problem.",
